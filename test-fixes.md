# Test Plan for Three Fixes

## Issue 1: Match status not changing when score is 0
**Test Steps:**
1. Start backend and frontend
2. Go to Admin Panel
3. Edit a match and set score to 0-0 or 0-1 etc.
4. Save the match
5. Check if match shows as "played" in UserView

**Expected Result:** Match should be marked as played and stats should update

## Issue 2: Form not showing after 3 games
**Test Steps:**
1. Play at least 3 league matches
2. Check UserView league table
3. Form column should show W/D/L indicators for each team

**Expected Result:** Form column shows last 3 results with colored indicators

## Issue 3: Cup final not showing finalists
**Test Steps:**
1. Complete both semi-final matches in Cup competition
2. Check Cup bracket in UserView
3. Final should show actual team names instead of "Winner of Semi-Final 1/2"

**Expected Result:** Final shows actual qualified teams

## Debug Info Added:
- Console log in form rendering
- Console log when match is marked as played
- Better error handling in updateCupProgression

## Changes Made:
1. **Backend - Match status fix:** Improved logic to handle 0 scores properly
2. **Backend - Cup final fix:** Added `isPublished: true` to final match creation
3. **Frontend - Form display:** Added debug logging and "-" for empty form
4. **CSS:** Added styling for no-form state
